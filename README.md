# Web OTP

This repository documents an API for accessing one time passwords to verify credentials (e.g. phone numbers).

* The [explainer](explainer.md) is a developer-oriented preview of the API.
* the [specification draft](index.html) is aimed at browser developers.

The API has a [test suite](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/sms) in the Web Platform Test project.

* Read the [how-to](HOWTO.md) instructions for example usage.
